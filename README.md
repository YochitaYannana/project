# project-Vulnerability-Scanning-f-Targeted-Ip-Address
This vulnerabilityscanning helps to identifying security weaknesses and flaws in systems and software running on them and provides solution to fix these vulnerabilities.
A vulnerability scan is an automated, high-level test that looks for and reports potential known vulnerabilities.
 For example, some vulnerability scans are able to identify over 50,000 unique external and/or internal weaknesses (i.e., different ways or methods that hackers can exploit your network).
So the aim is to Identify vulnerabilities of the targeted IP by using nessus vulnerability scanner and detect weaknesses in computers, computer systems, networks . Generate the report and analyze the vulnerabilities of targeted IP.
